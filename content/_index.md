# Thunder Network

Thunder Network is a digital ecosystem that integrates innovative solutions for managing avatars, operating systems, and browsers. Our main projects include **Internet Avatar**, **Livetar**, **Bolty**, **Matrix OS**, and **Matrix browser**. Our organizational structure is divided into three main areas: **Community**, **Research and Development (RaD)**, and **Studios**.

- **Community**: Handles events, community interaction, and moderation, creating an inclusive and dynamic environment for all participants.
- **Research and Development (RaD)**: The section that focuses on the design and development of our advanced technological products, always seeking innovations to meet digital needs.
- **Studios**: Our creative hub, responsible for producing multimedia content, including video and audio, to expand our impact.

## 1. **Internet Avatar (InAv)**

**InAv** allows users to have a unified digital identity, portable across different platforms, to maintain personalized continuity between websites, social media, and virtual spaces.

## 2. **Livetar**

**Livetar** is a social platform that allows anyone to be **anywhere in the world**, virtually and effortlessly. Through the use of avatars controlled by vectors, Livetar enables users to explore places and participate in activities remotely, without leaving home.

**Livetar** promotes **shared creative collaboration**: vectors, people who "lend" their bodies for the experience, collaborate with pilots, who control the avatars, to create unique and engaging content. This synergy allows creators and users to interact freely, exploring new possibilities for content creation, virtual travel, events, and more.

The idea behind Livetar is to turn the role of the vector into a true **job opportunity**, where their participation becomes a fundamental part of the social ecosystem, fostering a new mode of virtual interaction.

## 3. **Bolty**

**Bolty** is a multifunctional robot that connects Internet Avatar with platforms like Discord, Telegram, and the user themselves. Thanks to the integration with **Fleyd**, our artificial intelligence, Bolty facilitates communications and manages automated operations, enhancing the user experience.

## 4. **Matrix OS**

**Matrix OS** is an operating system optimized for Progressive Web Apps, ensuring high performance, security, and flexibility. Designed for desktop and mobile, Matrix OS is the ideal environment for developers and web users.

## 5. **Matrix** (browser)

**Matrix** is a browser built to perfectly support PWAs, with a strong focus on privacy, speed, and customization. It uses open-source technologies like **Rust**, offering a modern and secure browsing experience.

## 6. **Web TV and Web Radio**

**Thunder Network** expands its content through a **Web TV** and **Web Radio**, with channels broadcast on platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and major streaming services. These channels offer TV and radio-style programs, covering a wide range of content, from entertainment to information.

## 7. **Game Servers**

We are also creating dedicated servers for popular games such as **Minecraft**, **Roblox**, and **FiveM** (GTA V), offering unique and customized gaming spaces for our community.
